# CSS and GIT

We will make a website that shows our fellow students how git works and what it is. We will then deploy it to Github.


### Challenges
1. Create a CSS selector that makes it such that no longer how long a list is, the last one is always green.
2. Access the image without using an ID or a class and make it `100px` by `200px`
3. When I hover on an H1 with the class header, make it italic.
4. When I hover on an H1 without a class, make it BOLD
5. Add a CSS library that makes all the ULs with the class `code` to look like code.
